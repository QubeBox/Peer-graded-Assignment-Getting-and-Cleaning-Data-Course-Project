# Getting and Cleaning Data - peer assessment project

The original data was transformed by:-
    a. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
    b. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    c. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
    d. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names. 
    e. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

About variables: 
    1. x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files. 
    2. x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
